# Playground

This repo hosts a small personal site.

It’s a place for experiments, map demos, and random tools — mostly GIS and web-related. Some things are finished, some aren’t. That’s intentional.

## What’s here
- A simple static site
- Projects, prototypes, and experiments

## What it’s not
- A blog
- A polished portfolio

## Tech
- Plain HTML/CSS
- Minimal JavaScript
- Static hosting (GitHub Pages)

Things will change over time. Stuff may break or disappear.
